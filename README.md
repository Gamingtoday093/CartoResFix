# CartoResFix
Fixes the Low Resolution issue for Small Cartography Volumes in Unturned's `Level.CaptureSatelliteImage()` (Sadly not Chart, was a little too hard for me)

The new Resolution depends on the map's Size instead of a forced 1 Pixel per Meter. Meaning you shouldn't use this for Cartography Volumes Larger than the Map Size.

## Installation
